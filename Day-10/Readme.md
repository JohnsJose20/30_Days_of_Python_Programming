# Day-10: Python Set Operations

This repository contains simple Python tasks demonstrating set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

## Task 1: Set Union and Intersection

### Objective
Given two sets, find their union and intersection.

### Problem
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two sets of numbers.
2. Finds and prints the union (all unique elements from both sets).
3. Finds and prints the intersection (common elements between the two sets).

### Output
```python

Union of sets: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Intersection of sets: {4, 5}
```

# Task 2: Set Difference

### Objective
Given two sets, find the difference between the first set and the second.

### Problem
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two sets of numbers.
2. Finds and prints the elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.

### Output
```python

Difference (set1 - set2): {1, 2, 3}
```
