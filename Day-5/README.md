# Day 5: Task 1 : Lists (Operations)

## Objective
Understand lists and how to work with them.

## Topics
- What is a list?
- Creating and accessing lists
- List indexing
- Adding items to a list (`append()`)

## Key Concepts
- Lists are ordered collections of items.
- Accessing list elements by index.

## Task 1: Create and Manipulate a List of Favorite Foods

### Instructions:
1. Create a list of your favorite foods (e.g., `favorite_foods = ["pizza", "sushi", "ice cream"]`).

# Task 2 : Lists (Operations)

## Objective
Learn more operations you can perform on lists.

## Topics
- Removing an item from a list (`remove()`)
- Sorting a list (`sort()`)
- Slicing a list

## Key Concepts
- Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after they are created.
- You can remove items from a list, sort them, and slice them to extract specific parts of the list.

## Task 2: List Operations

### Instructions:
1. Create a list of fruits (e.g., `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange"]`).
2. Remove an item from the list using the `remove()` method (e.g., remove `"banana"`).
3. Sort the list alphabetically using the `sort()` method.
4. Slice the list to print a specific range of items (e.g., print the second and third items in the list).
5. Print the list after each operation to see the changes.
