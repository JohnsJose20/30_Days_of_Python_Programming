#  Day 6: Loops - For Loop Task: 1

## Objective: Master the for loop to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

##  Topics Covered:
1. What is a loop?
2. For loop: Iterating over sequences (e.g., lists, ranges).
3. Using range() to generate numbers.

##  Key Concepts:
- Loops allow repetitive execution of code blocks.
- A for loop iterates over sequences such as lists or ranges.
- The range() function generates a sequence of numbers.

##  Exercise:
# Task 1:
range(start, stop): Generates numbers from 'start' to 'stop'.
Example: range(1, 11) â†’ [1, 2, 3, ..., 10]

# Task 2:
Lists: A collection of items (e.g., names) that can be iterated using a for loop.
