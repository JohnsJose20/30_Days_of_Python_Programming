# Day 6: Loops - For Loop Task: 1

## Objective: Master the for loop to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.

## Topics Covered:
1. What is a loop?
2. For loop: Iterating over sequences (e.g., lists, ranges).
3. Using range() to generate numbers.

## Key Concepts:
- Loops allow repetitive execution of code blocks.
- A for loop iterates over sequences such as lists or ranges.
- The range() function generates a sequence of numbers.

## Notes:
1. range(start, stop): Generates numbers from 'start' to 'stop-1'.
   Example: range(1, 11) â†’ [1, 2, 3, ..., 10]

2. Lists: A collection of items (e.g., names) that can be iterated using a for loop.

# Task: 2: Loops - While Loop  

## Objective  
Learn how to use the `while` loop to execute repeated tasks based on a condition.  


## Topics Covered  
- What is a `while` loop?  
- Creating `while` loops with conditions  
- Stopping a loop using `break`  


## Key Concept  
The `while` loop allows us to repeat tasks as long as a condition remains `True`.  


## Tasks 2

### Task 2: Name Input Program  
Write a program that:  
1. Repeatedly asks the user to enter their name.  
2. Stops asking when the user types `"stop"`.  
3. Greets the user each time they provide a name.
