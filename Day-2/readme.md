# Day 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations
## *Task*: Perform basic arithmetic operations using Python.

*Description*:
In Python, you can use arithmetic operators to perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operators can be applied to numbers directly or variables holding numerical values.

*Example*:
```python
# Performing basic arithmetic operations
a = 10
b = 5

# Addition
print(a + b)  # Output: 15

# Subtraction
print(a - b)  # Output: 5

# Multiplication
print(a * b)  # Output: 50

# Division
print(a / b)  # Output: 2.0
