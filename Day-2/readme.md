# Day 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations and Check for Positive, Negative, or Zero
## *Task*1: Perform basic arithmetic operations using Python.

*Description*:
In Python, you can use arithmetic operators to perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operators can be applied to numbers directly or variables holding numerical values.

*Example* Task 1:
```python
# Performing basic arithmetic operations
a = 10
b = 5

# Addition
print(a + b)  # Output: 15

# Subtraction
print(a - b)  # Output: 5

# Multiplication
print(a * b)  # Output: 50


# Division
print(a / b)  # Output: 2.0
```

## *Task*2: Check for Positive, Negative, or Zero

*Description*:
In this program, we will check whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

*Example* Task 2:

```python
#Task 2:
# Asking the user to input a number
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Checking if the number is positive, negative, or zero
if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")

# Example:
# Input: -5
# Output: The number is negative.

# Input: 0
# Output: The number is zero.

# Input: 10
# Output: The number is positive.
