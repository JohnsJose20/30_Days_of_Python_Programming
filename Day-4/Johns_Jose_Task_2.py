Description:A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence 
(like a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range) and execute a block 
of code multiple times. The for loop is generally used when you know 
beforehand how many times you want the loop to run.

for i in range(1, num_rows + 1):
    print("*" * i)
